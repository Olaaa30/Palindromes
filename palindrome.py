# Palindromic numbers
# A palindrome is a word that reads the same way forwards and backwards.(E.g Tenet, 101101)
# Write a function that prints out all Palindromic numbers less than a given input,
# and returns the total number â€”of palindromesâ€” found!
# E.G: f(500) would print all Palindromic numbers less than 500,
# as well as the total number of palindromes less than 500.
# int objects are not iterable

    # mylist = []

    for i in range(x):
        # for num in str(i):
        string = str(i)
        if string[::-1] == string[0:]:
            if len(string)>1:
                num+=1
                print(string)
                # mylist.append(string)
